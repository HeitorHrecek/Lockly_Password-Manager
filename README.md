# Lockly

In this project called **Lockly**, *GustavoNakamuraC*, *HeitorHrecek* and *vitorvieirah* developed a password manager for our bimonthly activity at **Unicesumar**. The goal of this application is to store, manage, and also suggest strong passwords for users, so they can feel more secure. Additionally, the intention is to help users stay better organized. We hope this project will also help the Github community.
